## Definitions

### [Nash equilibrium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nash_equilibrium)

>In a Nash equilibrium, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players, and no one has anything to gain by changing only one's own strategy.
~Wikipedia


### [Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency)

>situation where no individual or preference criterion can be made better off without making at least one individual or preference criterion worse off

### [Price of anarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_anarchy)

>Concept in economics and game theory that measures how the efficiency of a system degrades due to selfish behavior of its agents.
>Ratio between the 'worst equilibrium' and the optimal 'centralized' solution
~Wikipedia


### [Price of stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Price_of_stability)

>Ratio between the best objective function value of one of its equilibria and that of an optimal outcome.
~Wikipedia

### [Braess paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess's_paradox)

## Questions

### Nash vs Pareto

>The Nash equilibrium may sometimes appear non-rational in a third-person perspective. This is because a Nash equilibrium is not necessarily Pareto optimal.

## Extra

### *strict* Nash equilibrium

>A game can have more than one Nash equilibrium. Even if the equilibrium is unique, it might be weak: a player might be indifferent among several strategies given the other players' choices. It is unique and called a strict Nash equilibrium if the inequality is strict so one strategy is the unique best response.
